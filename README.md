## ðŸŒ± About Me

Iâ€™m Yash Sethi â€” a data science practitioner with a foundation in mathematics, a mind wired for problem-solving, and a genuine passion for uncovering insight in complexity.

My journey into data didnâ€™t start with a course or a bootcamp â€” it began with equations, theorems, and a quiet curiosity cultivated during my Bachelors and Masters in Mathematics, with a minor in Statistics. Through those years, I learned how to think structurally, reason rigorously, and code with purpose â€” skills that later became the bedrock of my career in data science.

I took my first steps into the field at HSBC, where I worked across two distinctly different domains: marketing analytics and fraud mitigation. These experiences didnâ€™t just give me technical depth â€” they offered perspective. I learned how data can drive campaigns one day and protect customers from fraud the next. I became fluent in building models that didnâ€™t just predict, but made a measurable difference in business outcomes.

To expand my capabilities, I pursued a Master of Management in Analytics at McGill University, where I explored the full breadth of the data science lifecycle â€” from data engineering and ML modeling to dashboarding and deploying AI agents. During the program, I worked as a consultant for BNP Paribas, ALDO, and Lâ€™OrÃ©al, solving diverse business challenges using advanced analytics and machine learning.

Today, I specialize in building end-to-end AI-powered solutions, especially those involving LLMs, Machine Learning architectures, and intelligent visualizations. 

âš¡ Fun Fact: When Iâ€™m not working with data, Iâ€™m usually go for a run, solve puzzles, learn French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, or strum ukulele Iâ€™ve been teaching myself for over 1300 days.

If youâ€™re working on a data-driven problem â€” or even just want to chat about the future of AI â€” letâ€™s connect.
