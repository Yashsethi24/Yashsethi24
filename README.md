## ðŸŒ± About Me

Iâ€™m Yash Sethi â€” a data science practitioner with a foundation in mathematics, a mind wired for problem-solving, and a genuine passion for uncovering insight in complexity.

My journey into data didnâ€™t start with a course or a bootcamp â€” it began with equations, theorems, and a quiet curiosity cultivated during my Bachelors and Masters in Mathematics, with a minor in Statistics. Through those years, I learned how to think structurally, reason rigorously, and code with purpose â€” skills that later became the bedrock of my career in data science.

I took my first steps into the field at HSBC, where I worked across two distinctly different domains: marketing analytics and fraud mitigation. These experiences didnâ€™t just give me technical depth â€” they offered perspective. I learned how data can drive campaigns one day and protect customers from fraud the next. I became fluent in building models that didnâ€™t just predict, but made a measurable difference in business outcomes.

Craving a deeper understanding and a broader toolkit, I pursued a Master of Management in Analytics at McGill University. This program didnâ€™t just polish my existing skills â€” it expanded my horizons. From forecasting financial markets to optimizing supply chains and deploying AI agents, I immersed myself in the full lifecycle of data science.

During this time, I worked as a consultant on real-world challenges with global organizations like BNP Paribas, ALDO, and Lâ€™OrÃ©al â€” each project sharpening my ability to translate messy data into strategic action. Whether it was building predictive systems, conversational analytics bots, or optimization pipelines, I came away more confident in my ability to solve any data science problem thrown my way.

Today, I specialize in building end-to-end AI-powered solutions, especially those involving LLMs, API-driven architectures, and intelligent visualizations. I thrive at the intersection of logic and intuition â€” and Iâ€™m always looking for new puzzles to solve.

âš¡ Fun Fact: When Iâ€™m not working with data, Iâ€™m usually go for a run, solve puzzles, learn French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, or strum ukulele Iâ€™ve been teaching myself for over 1300 days.

If youâ€™re working on a data-driven problem â€” or even just want to chat about the future of AI â€” letâ€™s connect.
